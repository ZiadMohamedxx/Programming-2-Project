# ASCII Platform Game – C++ Project

This is a console-based 2D game developed in C++ as part of the Programming 2 course. The game features a hero character navigating a level filled with enemies, ladders, bullets, health pickups, and elevators — all rendered using ASCII characters. It demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, dynamic/static objects, and game logic.
